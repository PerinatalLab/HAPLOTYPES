# HAPLOTYPES
studies based on haplotyped trios/duos, in collaboration with CCHMC

### Scripts
The script check_phasing.R checks haplotype alignment inside trios after SHAPEIT phasing.


To include later: h1/h2/h3 haplotype splitting scripts, parent-of-origin analyses, genetic risk scores analyses, mendelian randomisation (with untransmitted haplotype).
